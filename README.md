Yield Prediction using SAR with Patch-Based 3D-CNN and ML Methods

This repository contains the Python code, trained models, and datasets used in our research on yield prediction for winter wheat, soybeans, and corn in Michigan (MI) using Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) observations. The research has been published in the journal Electronics and Computers in Agriculture. The paper can be accessed via DOI.
Project Overview

The goal of this project is to estimate crop yields using SAR data and machine learning techniques. We employed patch-based 3D-Convolutional Neural Networks (3D-CNNs) combined with other machine learning (ML) methods to predict yields for winter wheat, soybeans, and corn.
